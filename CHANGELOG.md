# Changelog

Format: see `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`. Dates are release-tag dates, not commit dates.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- LNCH-12: scheduled/background flow execution (`flow.schedule`, cron-triggered, ControlPanel
  visibility at `/api/admin/cron-schedules`).
- LNCH-16: optimistic locking on concept writes (`row_version`, compare-and-swap through
  `ConceptGateway`, 409-with-current-record conflict contract). See `docs/OPTIMISTIC_LOCKING.md`.
- LNCH-17: flow transaction-boundary contract — `onFailure` compensation steps (saga pattern,
  crash-resumable), documented atomicity/durability guarantees. See
  `docs/architecture/FLOW_TRANSACTION_CONTRACT.md`.
- LNCH-10 slice 1: CSV export (`GET /api/concepts/{concept}/export.csv`, streaming/paged, an
  Export CSV button on every generated grid). See `docs/CSV_EXPORT.md`.
- LNCH-21: `docs/architecture/APP_UPGRADE_CONTRACT.md` — the platform-owned/app-owned boundary in
  a generated FinalApp, written down precisely for the first time.
- LNCH-22: `docs/DSL_REFERENCE.md` (generated from the schema —
  `scripts/docs/generate_dsl_reference.py`), `docs/TUTORIAL_FIRST_APP.md` (golden-path tutorial,
  gate-tested by reusing the `simple-contact-intake` sample).
- LNCH-23: `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0, draft), `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`,
  `docs/adr/ADR-0007-distribution-model.md`, `scripts/quality/run-release-checklist-gate.ps1`.
- `docs/adr/ADR-0006-authoring-path.md`: the AI-first, editor-secondary authoring-path decision
  (LNCH-18).

### Behavior changes
- `JdbcBusinessConceptStore` now joins the ambient Spring transaction (via `DataSourceUtils`)
  instead of always opening an independent auto-committing connection. A generated concept's
  `create`/`update` service method (`@Transactional`) now genuinely rolls back its kernel-gateway
  write if a later step in the same method (e.g. the JPA persist) fails — previously these were
  two independent writes. No model-schema change; a pure correctness fix, but noted here since it
  changes observable rollback behavior under failure.

### Fixed
- A pre-existing gap where a `forEach` flow step's loop body (`collectionRef`/`itemKey`/
  `loopSteps`/`maxLoopIterations`) was silently dropped by the canonical-JSON round trip every
  generated app's `NPDevModelProvider` reads at boot — found while wiring LNCH-17's
  `onFailureSteps` through the same writer/reader.
- CSV export header repeating the `id` column twice (LNCH-10 slice 1).

## Prior history

Everything before this entry was tracked via `docs/LAUNCH_READINESS_GAPS.md`,
`docs/OPEN_GAPS_AND_ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/MATURITY_CLOSURE_LEDGER.md` rather than a changelog —
this file starts fresh from here forward. See those documents for the full history of Waves 1-4
and the platform's earlier maturity checkpoints.
