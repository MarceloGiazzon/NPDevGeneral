.SYNOPSIS
    AI knowledge substrate gate: proves the derived corpora can't silently drift from their sources.

.DESCRIPTION
    Fails (non-zero exit) if:
      1. a register/roadmap summary row contradicts its own detail section.
      2. knowledge/platform-status.json is stale vs a fresh extraction of the gaps ledger
         (docs/OPEN_GAPS_AND_ROADMAP.md) -- i.e. someone edited the ledger without regenerating.
      3. any knowledge/cards/*.json fails knowledge-card validation.
      4. the shared failure-signature normalizer self-check fails.
      5. the security pattern sweep no longer catches the bug shapes it was written for.
      6. the security pattern sweep finds an UNTRIAGED hit in the codebase.

    Checks 1, 5 and 6 all answer one question: are the instruments still honest? 1 and 5 verify the
    detectors; 6 actually points one at the repo -- the step whose absence let REG-46's own fix add
    8 untriaged hits unnoticed.

    Run before merging any change to the ledger, the cards, the AI knowledge scripts, or any code the
    sweep's patterns cover (SQL building, auth catches, template authorization guards).
