.SYNOPSIS
    AI knowledge substrate gate: proves the derived corpora can't silently drift from their sources.

.DESCRIPTION
    Fails (non-zero exit) if:
      1. knowledge/platform-status.json is stale vs a fresh extraction of the gaps ledger
         (docs/OPEN_GAPS_AND_ROADMAP.md) -- i.e. someone edited the ledger without regenerating.
      2. any knowledge/cards/*.json fails knowledge-card validation.
      3. the shared failure-signature normalizer self-check fails.
      4. the security pattern sweep no longer catches the bug shapes it was written for.

    Run before merging any change to the ledger, the cards, or the AI knowledge scripts.
