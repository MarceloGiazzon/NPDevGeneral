.SYNOPSIS
    AI knowledge substrate gate: proves the derived corpora can't silently drift from their sources.

.DESCRIPTION
    Fails (non-zero exit) if:
      1. knowledge/platform-status.json is stale vs a fresh extraction of the gaps ledger
         (docs/OPEN_GAPS_AND_ROADMAP.md) -- i.e. someone edited the ledger without regenerating.
      2. any knowledge/cards/*.json fails knowledge-card validation.
      3. the shared failure-signature normalizer self-check fails.

    Run before merging any change to the ledger, the cards, or the AI knowledge scripts.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/quality/run-ai-knowledge-gate.ps1

    [switch]$Fix  # regenerate the projection instead of only checking it
